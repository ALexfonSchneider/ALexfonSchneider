Hi, I'm Alexander Schneider.
I am a first-year student at the Institute of Digital Technologies of Electronics and Physics, Altai State University.

How to run:
First you need to compile both Project(SortingProgram and SortingProgramConsole).
Then copy/move SortingProgram.exe and SortingProgramConsole.exe in the any of your Project Folder.
Important that they have to be in the same directory.
After this you need to get all needing libraris (you can use windeployqt).
